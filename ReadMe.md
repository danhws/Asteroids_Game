# About The Project 

Asteroids is a classic arcade game, where a space ship moves through space destroying asteroids and occasional alien ships. The difficulty of the game increases as the levels progress. 

## Game Description

### Levels
The game is based on a series of increasingly more difficult levels. Once each is cleared, the next begins automatically. In the first level there will be only one slow moving asteroid, in the second there will be two and so on.

There are three types of asteroids:
- Large: These typically move very slowly and are large and therefore easier to shoot. When destroyed, two medium sized asteroids are created. These newly created asteroids will move in random directions and with random speeds but generally faster than the large asteroid was moving.
- Medium: These are a bit smaller than the large asteroids and a bit faster too. When destroyed, two small sized asteroids are created. These newly created asteroids will move in random directions and with random speeds but generally faster than the medium asteroid was moving.
- Small: These are again smaller and faster than the medium sized asteroids. When destroyed, no new asteroids are created.

Occasionally, an alien ship will appear and move through the screen from one side to the other. During this movement, it will fire at the players ship. The player can either avoid it or attempt to destroy it.

### Player
The players ship can perform 5 actions:

<b>Rotate Right</b> - Rotate the ship in the clockwise direction

<b>Rotate Left</b> - Rotate the ship in the anti-clockwise direction

<b>Fire</b> - Fire a bullet in the direction the ship is currently pointing

<b>Apply Thrust</b> - Add speed to the current motion in the direction the ship is currently pointing.

<b>Hyperspace Jump</b> - Disappear from current location and reappear in a new location on the screen.
